In this exercise, you will re-implement the function
`count_objects` to use the function `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label`.
The documentation for this function can be found at
<https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.16.0/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.measurements.label.html>.

0. Create a backup of the file `counting.py` called `counting.py.backup`
(you wouldn't have to do this if we were using Version Control).

1. In the original `counting.py`,
replace the code for the function `count_objects` with the following:

2. In the original `counting.py`, replace the code in `count_objects`:

```python
def count_objects(img):
    # ------ YOUR CODE HERE ------- #
    
    # ----------------------------- #
```

3. Re-run the tests to make sure nothing is broken!
